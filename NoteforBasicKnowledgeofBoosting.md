#### What is Boosting?
The term ‘Boosting’ refers to a family of algorithms which converts weak learner to 
strong learners. Boosting is an ensemble method for improving the model predictions 
of any given learning algorithm. The idea of boosting is to train weak learners sequentially, 
each trying to correct its predecessor.
